Across those identities is a strong pattern of capturing thoughts, recalling these captures, and orienting themselves and their work around this information. <br></br> Our team set out to create an experience that connects your whole life and uses data to deliver the right experience across applications, devices and modalities.  <br></br> We leveraged this human-centered, behavorial framework to create an iconic, human-centered service that weaves Microsoftâ€™s productivity ecosystem together across devices, modalities, and apps through voice."
