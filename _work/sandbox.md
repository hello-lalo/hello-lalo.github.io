<blockquote>Mathieu's diverse skillset has been incredibly valuable with driving my product forward. Despite my product being mature and complex, Mathieu was able to quickly dive in and start producing value with minimal guidance. By combining a strong understanding of design principles, with the technical knowhow of how to implement designs using the latest technologies, he's delivered pragmatic solutions to the challenges I present him with. Mathieu's been a pleasure to work with and I wholeheartedly endorse him.</blockquote>"
