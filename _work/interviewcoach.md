runin:            "Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have a broad range of conditions characterized by challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, speech and nonverbal communication. But neurodiverse individuals have unique talents that are beneficial and valuable to many employers. Because the average interview process is designed for neurotypical individuals, there is huge barrier and disadvantage for those with ASD to succeed in job interviews.  As Microsoft, we had an opportunity to buck this trend and level the playing field for neurodiverse individuals by leveraging emergent technologies like Mixed Reality and AI.
<br> </br> My team and I designed an award-winning VR experience that prepares individuals with cognitive disabilities for job interviews. As lead designer, I storyboarded the app experience, prototyped the hierarchical learning difficulty levels, art directed 3D coach avatars, and directed a promotional video showcasing the experience."
