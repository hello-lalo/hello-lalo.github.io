runin:            "Many neurodiversity diagnoses, like autism, are associated with deviance in social cognition from neurotypical behavior. This creates a huge barrier for employment since interview processes assume a neurotypical set of social cognition skills.Â 
As Microsoft, we have an opportunity to buck this trend and level the playing field for neurodiverse individuals by leveraging emergent technologies like Mixed Reality and AI.
<br> </br> My team and I designed an award-winning VR experience that prepares individuals with cognitive disabilities for job interviews. As lead designer, I storyboarded the app experience, prototyped the hierarchical learning difficulty levels, art directed 3D coach avatars, and directed a promotional video showcasing the experience."
