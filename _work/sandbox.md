runin:            "I created a website for our partners to leverage Sandbox, a prototyping platform that enables you to design and prototype with live data and device features. Our team created this platform in order to pull live data from the Microsoft Graph into design prototypes, allow native apps to accesse device features like haptic feedback, camera, and microphone access, and have the ability to run a single prototype on multiple types of devices through our Sandbox native apps. The Sandbox website provided our partners with a jumpstart guide on how to set up and work in Sandbox, Sandbox API Documentation, example demos, and a channel to connect with the team and share work with the design community.
